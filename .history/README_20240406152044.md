# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Shiftkey Works Software Assessment Repository

Welcome to the Shiftkey Works Software Assessment Repository! This repository is designed to evaluate the skills of candidates applying for frontend, backend, and full-stack roles within our team. Below you will find instructions on how to contribute to the repository, complete assessments, and submit your work for review.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will allow you to work independently on the assessment.

2. **Choose Your Assessment Path**: Decide which role you are applying for:
   - **Frontend**: If you're interested in the frontend role, focus on the `frontend` branch which contains a React JS setup.
   - **Backend**: For backend roles, switch to the `backend` branch, where you'll find a Node.js TypeScript setup.
   - **Full Stack**: If you're applying for a full-stack position, you'll need to complete tasks in both branches to showcase your versatility.

3. **Read Branch-Specific Instructions**: Each branch contains detailed instructions for the assessment. Make sure to read these carefully to understand the scope and requirements of the task.

## Contributing

After selecting your path and familiarizing yourself with the tasks, it's time to start coding. Here's how to submit your work:

1. **Complete the Assessment**: Work on the tasks outlined in the branch related to your chosen role. Ensure your solution is polished and meets all stated requirements.

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Once you've completed the assessment, create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to the respective branch (`frontend` or `backend`) of the main repository. For full-stack applicants, you may need to create two separate PRs for each branch.

3. **Describe Your Contribution**: In your PR, provide a detailed description of what you've accomplished, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them. Include a link to a working demo of your solution, if possible.

4. **Feedback and Questions**: Should you encounter any difficulties or have questions during the assessment, feel free to reach out to us:

My contribution: 
I have made a todo list/ task manager where the user can add delete and search for tasks, with an optional description of the task. The description of the task can be toggled on and off by clicking on the particular task.

You can also set the task as complete by clicking on a check button, which turns the task green. Regularly hovering over a note will turn it blue, and while hovering over a note in delete mode will turn it 
red. You can also search for a task and the ost relevant note will be at the top.

A challenge I faced while making this ap was creating tests for it as I have never done such a thing before.

To fix this solution I learned how to use vitest and writing tests with render and fire event from jest dom and testing library/react and using some functions from their library like getByText, getById and 
queryByText ect...

This task manager can be used on https://main--taskmanagerassesment.netlify.app
